  Will show a new set of buttons to let a director control what scene a guest
  video appears in.

# \&scenes



{% hint style="danger" %}
Deprecated since v17. The buttons added by this parameter are now part of the regular director UI.
{% endhint %}

## Details

Scene=2 is still quite special, as it will only show the last video added, so keep that in mind currently

You can create custom view links for these new scene options; these links are not provided for you.

An example link might be, [https://obs.ninja/?room=xxxx\&scene=4](https://obs.ninja/?room=xxxx\&scene=4) , which correlates to button "S4".
