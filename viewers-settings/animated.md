## Details

Videos in a group scene will slide around the screen when being re-arranged, such as when a new video gets added to the scene.\
\
Mobile phone users will not have this effect enabled by default, but most other guest and scene types will.

You can force enable this animation effect by adding `&animate` to the URL, or you can force disable the effect by passing false, such as `&animate=false` , or passing `0`, `no`, or `off`.
