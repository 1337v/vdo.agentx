## Details

{% hint style="warning" %}
**First** director **to join** a room **claims the room**. There can be ONLY ONE! (1)
{% endhint %}

Other faux-directors can join, but they won't have any power over guests.

If the first director refreshes, they will likely still claim the room even if other faux-directors are already connected.

Directors have powers over some aspects of those in a group room and its scenes, such as the ability to hangup remote guests
