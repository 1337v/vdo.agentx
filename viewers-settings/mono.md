description: Has the inbound audio playback as mono audio

# \&mono

## Details

{% hint style="info" %}
Will not work with Firefox; Firefox's playback will still be in stereo if the source is stereo.
{% endhint %}

If using [`&proaudio`](../general-settings/stereo.md), this will retain the publishing benefits of [`&proaudio`](../general-settings/stereo.md), while keeping the audio as mono instead of stereo.

Audio bitrates may be reduced from 256-kbps to 128-kbps, if not explicitly stated, in some cases.
