# \&manual

This is an advanced feature, for primarily developers, who wish to utilize their own auto-mixing code or perhaps are not using VDO.Ninja for video/audio specifically.&#x20;

`session.rpcs` is an object that can be queried for a list of active receiving peer sessions. `session.rpcs[UUID].videoElement.srcObject` contains video/audio data if available.
