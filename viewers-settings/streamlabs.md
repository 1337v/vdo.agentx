## Details

Tells VDO.Ninja to not block VDO.Ninja from attempting to run when using Streamlabs OBS for macOS.

For normal OBS users, update to OBS 26.1.2 on macOS to obtain native support for OBS.Ninja in OBS.

StreamLabs for OBS doesn't yet have full support for VDO.Ninja; consider the Electron Capture app if it fails to work well.
