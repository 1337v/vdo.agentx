# \&darkmode

Enables the dark-mode stylings of the website

Conversely, setting `&lightmode`, `&darkmode=0` or `&darkmode=false` will disable the dark-mode, forcing the light-mode.

The dark-mode will be selected automatically by default if your system is set to dark color mode, so this flag can be used to override that.&#x20;
