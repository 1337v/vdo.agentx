description: The screen-share of the guest will have the same label as the guest

# \&screensharelabel

## Aliases

* `&sslabel`

## Details

Without it set, screen shares do not have a label applied to them. With it added to the guest, it will use the existing [`&label`](../advanced-settings/setup-parameters/label.md) value or whatever value has been passed to it. This changes the default behaviour, but it offers more flexibility and is probably the preferred default behaviour for most users.
