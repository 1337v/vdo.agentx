# VDO.Ninja Cheat Sheets

## BASIC CONCEPTS

To understand VDO.Ninja, you have to understand its three main components: 

* The GROUP ROOM allows guests to hear and see each other. GROUP ROOMs are automtatically created by guests joining them through an invitation link in a browser (preferably Chrome). No further configuration is required (but possible by adding parameters to the invitation link).
* SCENES & SOLO LINKS are a way for the producer/director to add guests to OBS, vMix, etc.
* The CONTROL CENTER gives the director control over the guests' status. This includes mute/unmute, visibility in scenes or transfers to other rooms.
