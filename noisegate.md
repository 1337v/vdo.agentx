# \&noisegate

If someone else is speaking in a group call, your microphone gets muted automatically.

The point of this feature is to allow guests who might be in a rather noisy room or who are unable to use echo cancellation to still engage with a chat, without them introducing feedback back into the room.\

This is a very hard and aggressive noise filter, and a guest won't be audible to others in the room if others in the room are currently talking.

User feedback on this feature welcomed.
