# Known Issues

Known issues that are most critical are normally listed on the main page of VDO.Ninja.\
\
You can also refer to the #report-bugs channel on discord, at https://discord.vdo.ninja, to see recently reported issues. I push bug fixes daily to beta, at https://vdo.ninja/beta, so give that a shot if you find a bug on the main release.

Since bugs and issues are ever evolving, it's hard to keep all issues up to date and verified.\
\
Below are some links to third parties, for a list of known issues that commonly will apply to VDO.Ninja as well:\
