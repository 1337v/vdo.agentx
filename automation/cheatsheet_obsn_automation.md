# OBS Ninja Cheat Sheets

## AUTOMATING OBSN START-UP (currently in beta only)

For regularly repeated setups you can automate a lot of the parameters:

* audio input device
* video input device
* audio output device
* guest names (stream IDs and labels)

Depending on your platform, you can put all these into scripts or even apps for easy recall.
