# \&miconly

Mostly just an alias of `&vd=0&webcam` , but it also further hides the option to later select a video device via the settings menu. It also hides the 'mute camera' and screen-share buttons.

This is a useful option for when you want a guest to join a room and only publish audio, with no opportunity to share video.
