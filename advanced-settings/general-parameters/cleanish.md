description: Cleaner output; not as clean as &cleanoutput

# \&cleanish

## Details

Same as [`&cleanoutput`](cleanoutput.md), except it still shows the play button that allows handling gesture requirements in chrome.

Director direct overlay messages are still visible.

When using `&cleanish` and [`&record`](../source-parameters/and-record.md), you'll get the record button showing, but nothing else.
