# View Parameters

**Viewer's Settings**, which are aspects that are controllable by the viewer's side, which includes bitrate, codec, and layouts. These parameters are mostly added to [`&view`](view.md) and [`&scene`](scene.md) links. But some of them can also be added to guests and to the director.
