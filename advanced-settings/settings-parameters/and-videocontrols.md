# \&videocontrols

## Aliases

* `&controls`

## Details

`&videocontrols` is a publisher's side parameter. It shows the video control bar (provides access to full screen on mobile). You can also show the control bar with `Right-Click` -> `Show control bar`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is not the same control bar as the user control bar. Also, be sure to not accidentally unmute yourself -- echo feedback galore.
{% endhint %}
