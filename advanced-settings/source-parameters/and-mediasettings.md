## Details

Adds the option for a guest to change the video "quality" (resolution) dynamically:

* Max Resolution (1920x1080p)
* Balanced (1280x720p)
* Smooth and Cool (720x360p)

Outside of a room it is enabled by default. You can preset the resolution with [`&quality`](../../source-settings/quality.md).
