# \&screenshare

## Aliases

* `&ss`

## Details

This will allow the guest to screenshare by being directly asked to share a screen or window instead of being take to the camera/screenshare selection screen.

Starting with [v19](../../release-notes/v19.md) of VDO.Ninja, there is also the [`&screenshare2`](../newly-added-parameters/and-screenshare2.md) option; a minor UI variant that requires an additional button press, but more clearly preps the guest to the fact they will be sharing their screen.
