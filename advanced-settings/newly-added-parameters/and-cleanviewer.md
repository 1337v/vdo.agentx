# \&cleanviewer

## Aliases

* `&cv`

## Details

This is the exact same thing as [`&cleanoutput`](../general-parameters/cleanoutput.md), except it only triggers if added to a view-only link.

Hides many of the UI elements and pop-ups that may cause unwanted visual elements not desired in a high-stakes live stream.
