# \&channels

Left and right is available for most users; channels 1 and 2

* Up to 6-channels is possible, if your output device supports it.
* On Windows, you might need to select 5.1 surround sound with your device in the Windows audio settings
* On macOS, you might want to consider using SoundFlower, as it seems the most correct with its routing.

{% hint style="info" %}
Update in v17: \&channels is displayed by default now
