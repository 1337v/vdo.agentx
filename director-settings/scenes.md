  Will show a new set of buttons to let a director control what scene a guest
  video appears in.

# \&scenes

{% hint style="info" %}
Scene=2 is still quite special, as it will only show the last video added, so keep that in mind currently.
{% endhint %}

You can create custom view links for these new scene options; these links are not provided for you.

An example link might be

```
https://obs.ninja/?room=xxxx&scene=4
```

which correlates to button "S4".
