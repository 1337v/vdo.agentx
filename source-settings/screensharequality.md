# \&screensharequality

When a guest shares their screen during a group chat, it creates a secondary VDO.Ninja session to share that screen, alongside their active webcam.  Two streams as a result.\
\
Using this parameter will give you control over the quality of the screen share, specifically, overriding what you might have set with \&quality.    It will not impact the webcam quality.
