# \&order

## Options

| Value                    | Description                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| (positive integer value) | Higher order, drawn first on screen |

## Details

The director can change this value remotely, changing the order of a video in a mixed scene of videos.

If two videos have the same order value, the mixer will decide on its own which is drawn first of the two.

Order is Left to Right; Top to Bottom.
