# Sponsor ‚ù§

While VDO.Ninja is a passion project and is free to use, there are some costs involved in providing it. Sponsoring the maintainer/developer of VDO.Ninja helps directly with subsidizing those costs.

To do so, please visit Steve Seguin's [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/steveseguin) page.

While GitHub Sponsors is the preferred way to donate, there is also [PayPal](https://paypal.me/steveseguin) and [buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/steveseguin). Some crypto options are also listed on my GitHub Sponsors page, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you wish to contribute financially in other ways, please contact Steve directly: [steve@seguin.email](mailto:steve@seguin.email)

If you do sponsor Steve, be sure to let him know on Discord so he can thank you personally; he will also provide you access to a Sponsors-only Discord channel if you do.

Another way to contribute to VDO.Ninja is via user feedback and suggestions; both are highly-valued as well. Spreading the word of VDO.Ninja to those who may find it useful is also greatly appreciated. Community involvement, such as helping to support other users, writing user-guides, and even showcasing what you've made with VDO.Ninja is also appreciated.

If you'd like to grab a VDO.Ninja branded sticker or mug, there is a merch store with a 0% commission fee set. It won't financially support the project, but it's always motivating to see them randomly in a stream. [https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/88897940](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/88897940)
