# \&easyexit

alias \&ee\
\
To prevent accidental page refreshes or exits during a stream, VDO.Ninja will ask the user to confirm they wish to leave the page when they try to.  Using `&easyexit` prevents this confirmation pop-up from occurring, which might be useful if you are doing a lot of testing and find the added clicking to be annoying.
