# v16.3

This is just a minor version update; pushing it out so I can start getting v17 into beta.

* \&rooms=room1,room2 has been added for easier multi room transfer (via duncan)
* \&website embedding has been greatly improved; twitch/youtube support streamlined.
* guests will get a message when transferred
*   \&scenes can be used by the director to allow for more scene buttons (\&scene=3 for example can be used now)

    ( \&scene=2 is funky, so keep that in mind if using it )
* \&showchannels is added to the director's options; it lets you output audio of a guest to a different audio channel>
* improve mobile support; rotating the phone doesn't break the sizing of videos (bug in v16 fixed)
* \&vd and \&ad now support device names and still device sink IDs.
* changed the fullscreen icons
* languages updated (dutch)
* numerous other polish items added, including some fixes contributed via github by users.

Thank you to everyone for the feedback and suggestions. -steve
