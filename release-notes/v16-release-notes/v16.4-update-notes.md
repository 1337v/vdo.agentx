# v16.4

Version 16.4 release notes

Another minor update; trying to get stability to 100% before pushing forwards.

* \&effects=4 5 and 6 have been added; though they are purely experimental and buggy. (greenscreen, boken blur, avatar)
* tweaked the packet loss graph on the obsn/speedtest (moving average instead of being just an average)
* fixed a few bugs related to iOS sources in OBS on PC rendering incorrect overlays, labels, etc
* adding \&pcm to the URL will have video recordings be saved as Video + PCM audio format
* added a fix rainbow puke button to the director's room; it's going to be removed once OBS updates chromium on PC, but for now it can fix issues with heavy packet loss glitching
* added the ability to start/stop local video recording from the iFRAME AP
* Some styling tweaks; \&rooms etc
* More stats added to the stats debug page , while hiding some useless ones to free up some room
* in the top-right there is now a basic stats readout; viewer count, bitrate, cpu-load issues
* modal boxes have replaced alert popups
* changed the camera icon from an eye to a video cam
* passwords now support special characters
* you can now add a password via the Add camera to OBS page
* you will get booted out of a room if your stream ID is already in use -- prevents accidental creeping
* iOS native app out, even if basic -- [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/capture-for-obs-ninja/id1553645446](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/capture-for-obs-ninja/id1553645446)
