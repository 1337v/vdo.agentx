## Details

Tally lights are represented as a glowing red border around videos. When the light is on, the video is considered "VISIBLE" within OBS Studio. This is based on whether OBS Studio tells VDO.Ninja if a video is active or not.

{% hint style="info" %}
Videos on **first-load** in OBS, even if visible in OBS, **don't glow red**; it requires an **initial visibility change to trigger it**.
{% endhint %}
