## Options

| Value | Description                                                                             |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | will only show one speaker at a time; the loudest or last-loud speaker                  |
| 2     | will show whoever is talking; mixed together; if no one is talking, just shows yourself |

In both cases, if someone else is talking/active, your local preview will become a mini-preview in the top right.
