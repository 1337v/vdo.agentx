# \&activespeaker

* \&activespeaker=1 will only show one speaker at a time; the loudest or last-loud speaker.
* \&activespeaker=2 will show whoever is talking; mixed together. If no one is talking, just shows yourself.
* in both cases, if someone else is talking/active, your local preview will become a mini-preview in the top right.

## Aliases

* `&sas`
* `&speakerview`
