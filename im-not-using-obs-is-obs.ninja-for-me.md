# I'm not using OBS; is VDO.Ninja for me?

The technologies used in the creation of [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja) are application agnostic. It doesnâ€™t know how the output URL is being used.

To that end, **any software that can use a browser-based source or has window-capture capabilities should be compatible with VDO.Ninja.** This includes **VMix**, **ManyCam**, custom Electron.js-based applications, and more.

Please note, VDO.Ninja is tested to be compatible with OBS ([obsproject.com](http://obsproject.com)), and there are some added OBS-specific optimizations included with VDO.Ninja. Tally lights may not work for example with other software.
